# Trusty To-Do List
This project is an intuitive and interactive to-do list application that offers a simple and effective user experience. Developed as a key part of my learning journey in mastering the essentials of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application is designed to effectively manage tasks. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and check off tasks, providing an efficient tool for personal task management.

## Objective
The objective of this project was to create a simple, user-friendly, and interactive to-do list. The user can add tasks, edit task names and due dates, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks. The tasks are saved to the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is reloaded.

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Strategy
Here are the key strategies I employed:

### HTML
- **Structure:** The HTML is kept minimal, with the structure primarily comprising input fields for new tasks and a container for displaying tasks.
- **Dynamic Content:** Most of the content is dynamically generated by JavaScript, keeping the HTML clean and focused.

### CSS
- **Grid Layout:** CSS grid layout is heavily used to create a responsive design, ensuring elements are well aligned irrespective of the screen size.
- **Custom Styles:** I created custom styles for different task states, such as completed tasks, and for interactive elements like buttons.

### JavaScript
- **DOM Manipulation:** JavaScript is used to handle user interactions and manipulate the DOM. It allows for dynamic updates on the webpage in response to user inputs.
- **Local Storage:** The application makes good use of the browser's local storage. When a task is added, edited, marked as complete, or deleted, the change is saved to local storage for data persistence.
- **User Interaction:** Events like clicking buttons or checkboxes trigger JavaScript functions that add, edit, or delete tasks.

## Lessons Learned
JavaScript is used to handle user interactions and manipulate the DOM. When a task is added, edited, marked as complete, or deleted, the change is saved to the browser's local storage, allowing data persistence.

## Future Work
I plan to now work on a bigger project that incorporates everything I learned and more, to create a more presentable and holistic website experience.
